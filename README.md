Spring Boot application for managing access control

### Description

This Spring boot application is the backend of our access control implementation. In order for a guest to access an event, he has to prove ownership over his ETH address.
To do this, he will be prompted with a random string. He then needs to sign this string using the eth address holding the tickets.
This will proof ownership of the address.
